# Badger Color Theme

Dark Emacs 24 color theme (using deftheme). Inspired by the wombat theme, primarily.

## Installing

If you don't already know how to install a theme in Emacs, you can try this:

    (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "path/to/badger-theme-directory")
    (load-theme 'badger t)
    
    ;; OR via use-package
    
    (use-package badger-theme
      :ensure t
      :config (load-theme 'badger t))

## Org Mode

Some people might prefer the headline after a DONE keyword to be ~~struck-through~~. Add the following code to your init file:

    (setq org-fontify-done-headline t)

Note that this strikethough extends to the end of the line, so if you tag a headline the strikethrough extends over empty space to reach the tag:

![alt text](https://raw.github.com/ccann/badger-theme/master/img/strikethrough.png "ugly strikethrough")

This doesn't look great, IMO.

If you would prefer the DONE keyword to not have the stikethrough effect use 

    M-x customize-face RET org-done

and change stike-through's value to Off. Save this change so that it applies to future emacs sessions.
